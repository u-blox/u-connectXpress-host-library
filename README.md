# Introduction

The u-connectXpress host library is an example on how to interface the
u-blox standalone shortrange modules with a host of any kind.
The AT commands are normally transmitted in the AT mode, but
this library also supports transmitting AT commands and receiving data using the
Extended Data Mode (EDM), which significantly simplifies the development of
more advanced products on the host MCU.

The u-connectXpress AT protocol is implemented in the u-connectXpress software for the following u-blox standalone shortrange modules:

* ANNA-B1
* NINA-B1
* NINA-B2
* NINA-B31
* NINA-W13
* NINA-W15
* ODIN-W2

Use this library on the host to

* Transmit AT commands to the module using AT mode or EDM
* Receive and manage URC responses using  AT mode or EDM
* Transmit raw data to any peer connected to the module using Data mode or EDM
* Receive raw data from any peer connected to the module using Data mode or EDM

While this example is written for Windows, it is trivial to convert it to any other host, 
including Raspberry PI, FreeRTOS, or hostless embedded MCUs such as STMicroelectronics STM32 series.

## Usage

### Running your first example on CygWin

The example will issue some commands to your module, and display the responses.

+ Connect a NINA-W13, NINA-W15 or ODIN-W2 to your computer.
+ Define the serial port to use in the `include/ucxh_config.h` file.
+ Open a command terminal on your PC and start 

      ./runExamples.sh --run ex_readmisc

\ref ex_readmisc "More information ..." 

### Running the second examples on CygWin

This example will show how to communicate with another device over WiFi, using 
EDM between your NINA-W13, NINA-W14 or ODIN-W2 module and your PC.

+ Connect a NINA-W13, NINA-W15 or ODIN-W2 to your computer.
+ Define the serial port to use in the `include/ucxh_config.h` file.
+ Configure your network and create a small server.
  This can be done either by connecting to your existing network, and using your computer as a server, or 
  by using another NINA-W10/W13 or ODIN-W2 as WiFi AP and/or server.

  * To use another u-blox module as WiFi AP and server, configure it to use
    IP number and gateway address `192.168.2.1`, and  enable a TCP server on port `12345`.
    This is easiest done using `s-center`.

     + In s-center, connect to the u-blox standalone module you intend to use as WiFI AP.
     + From the File menu, select Download Configuration
       and select the file `resources/config_ex_callbacks_edm_wifi.txt`.
     + Once the module has activated the WiFi AP, enter Data Mode, by pressing the button at the bottom.
     + Open a command terminal on your PC and start 

            ./runExamples.sh --run ex_callbacks_edm_wifi

     + When propmted by the example, type something into the s-center input box.
       Some text appears on the program's terminal, and the example will echo back the result.

  * To use your own network and PC as server you need some form of program capable of accepting 
    incoming connections on your pc, such as `nc`.

      + Edit the `examples/ex_config.h` file, and replace the SSID, and password with the one
        used on your network, and the IP-number with your PC's IP-number.
      + Open a command terminal on your PC, start netcat using 

            nc -l -k 12345

      + Open a new terminal on your PC and start

            ./runExamples.sh --run ex_callbacks_edm_wifi

      + When propmted by the example, type something into netcat's terminal.
        Some text appears on the program's terminal, and the example will echo back the result.
  
Independent on method, the example will quit automatically after 2 minutes. It can also
be aborted by sending the line `quit` from the server.

### Using the AT command library with your host application

+ ensure your `include/ucxh_config.h` is configured properly
+ Compile and link the files
in the `src` directory as well as the
`src/windows/ucxh_serial_win.c` file with your application.

## Examples

### ex_readmisc

This example shows how to read various parameters from the module.

\ref ex_readmisc "More information ..." 

### ex_callbacks_edm_wifi

This example is a shows how to connect to a remote host using EDM:

 + Enter Extended Data Mode (EDM)
 + Configure the module as a WiFi station
 + Wait until the WiFi link is up and the module has received a DHCP IP address.
 + Connect to a server (for example a PC)
 + Transmit raw data to the server
 + Receive raw data from the server
 + Reboot

## Porting

The library has been tested using gcc on CygWin, with the only file which contains
Microsoft Windows-specific code, is ucxh_serial_win.c, in the `src/windows` directory.

Replace that file with code which implements the interface described in serial.h .

In order to port to an RTOS, such as FreeRTOS, a few lines needs to be changed in atParseResponse()
of the `src/ucxh_parser.c` file

## Testing

A number of test programs for unit-tests, and some programs 
with an expected output are also available, when `runExamples.sh` is executed:

### Unit-tests
